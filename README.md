# SendEmail-JavaScript-Code

Please make sure to replace the example email addresses and SMTP service provider with your actual email address, email password, and the SMTP service provider you want to use (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo, etc.) in order to send emails successfully. Also, ensure that you have the Nodemailer library installed in your Node.js project before running this code.
You can install it using npm or yarn, for example: npm install nodemailer.
